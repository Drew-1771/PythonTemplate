# PythonTemplate
This repository contains scripts to manage python environments.

## make_env.bat
This script generates a **basic** python virtual environment inside the current folder. Once a virtual environment is created, it cannot be easily moved, so it is intended you move this script to the desired folder where you want your environment to reside.

## activate.bat
This script is a 1 click activation of the above environment. Should reside next to the env folder.
